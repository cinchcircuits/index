We’ll go over each one, and how to solder them in place.\nScrew Terminal In your connector bag you’ll find a screw terminal connector. This provides power to the machine, and goes into the J12 footprint on the upper-right corner of the board. Ensure that the openings that accept the power cables are facing outwards.\nTODO: picture of the board with the connector soldered in correctly\nIDC Connectors The IDC connectors are the larger, black connectors in your connector bag. There are only two sizes, a 2x3 for feeder communication, and three 2x6 for the auxillary ports. Be sure to solder them the correct orientation. The slot on the connector should match up with the silkscreen.\nTODO: picture of these locations on the board, and connectors\nJST XH Connectors The bulk of the connectors on the board are JST XH connectors. These come in two, three, and four pin variations. The two pin connectors are for the mosfets, the three pin connectors are for the servos, limit switches, and ring lights, and the four pin connectors are for the stepper motors. Be sure to solder these with the correct orientation as dictated by the silkscreen.\nTODO: pics of all this\nUSB A Connectors There are three USB A connectors that need to be soldered into the board as well. Two of these are for the webcams, and the third is for future functionality. We recommend soldering the large structural tabs in place first, then soldering the four data pins afterward.\nTODO: pics of all this\nStepper Motor Driver Headers The last connectors that need to be soldered into the board are the 1x8 Dupont 0.1\" headers for the stepper motor drivers. Two connectors need to be soldered for each driver. We recommend soldering a single pin in place first while getting the connector to stay flat, then do the rest of the pins after the orientation is solidified.

Assembly Take the Left Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted.    Take the Left Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Left Back Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.    On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.    On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    Now, mount the NEMA?? stepper motor to the back left leg.

Please ensure that you’ve done some research to ensure you select the appropriate model, BOM, hardware, firmware and software combination.  To build your own index you will need to acquire the items listed on the BOM. This includes various mechanical components along with a significant number of 3D printed parts. When printing the 3d parts, be sure to print them with the recommended settings.\nTools The following tools are needed to build the Index.\n 2mm Allen Key 2.5mm Allen Key 3mm Allen Key 4mm Allen Key Fine Tip Tweezers (for positioning T-Nuts) Pliers / Vice Grips Utility Knife / Precision Blade  Tips \u0026 Tricks When assembling the Index, the following tips will help the process go more smoothly.\n Clean up your 3D prints well. Make sure that you have removed any support material, and have cleaned up the edges of any holes. Test that you can fit the V-Slot or machine screw for a specific part into the hole. Deburr the aluminum profile at the ends. Then it’s easier to put parts together. Slot Nuts come in two different formats. One form can be inserted into the slot through the slot. The other form must be inserted from the end. Watch for notes in the about when to insert based on which type you’re using. Positioning Slot Nuts can be a bit of a challenge. A simple way to get them into the right place is to use gravity to get them close, and then use either the long end an allen key or a pair of fine tipped tweezers to push or pull them to the exact position. Inserting Belts can be easier if you move the gantry you’re inserting the belt into to the middle of the rail it is on and then as you insert the belt, move it away from the side you want the belt to come out from. The v-slot will catch the belt and once you’ve moved the gantry a little bit, you will be able to catch the belt. Passing a belt through a belt slot from the inner side can be easier if you place an exacto knife blade at the back side of the slot and butt the belt against that while drawing it up through the slot. Press Fit Nuts are used in several places. If your printer tolerances make it so these nuts don’t stay in you can use a piece of tape over the back to hold them in temporarily.

This is done by turning a potentiometer with a small flathead screwdriver (one is provided in your PCB kit).\nCaution The screwdriver included in your kit has a ceramic tip to prevent any accidential conduction. This means that it is very fragile. Be incredibly careful with the tip, and do not apply any excessive force when adjusting the potentiometer.  On any driver, use a multimeter to measure the voltage between the GND pin and the Vref pad as shown in the image below.\n  This voltage dictates how much current the driver will run through the stepper motor, and can be adjusted by turning the potentiometer (shown in the diagram above).

This is not an absolute guarantee that the connection to the STM32 works though. Check if all solder joints look fine Check if all necessary voltages are present (Mobo input voltage, 5V rail and 3.3V rail) Keep in mind that a blank STM32 should still appear as a USB device, even if it has no firmware loaded onto it Check the 8MHz crystal oscillator of the SMT32. Its correct operation is important for DFU. Wrong frequency and / or incorrect load capacitors can cause issues. Use an oscilloscope to probe the signal. You should see a smooth sine wave with stable frequency.  Alternative method to upload: This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent).

Pull the hex nut fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into it from the opposite side of the Y gantry body. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw. Repeat steps 1-2 for the remaining seven M5 nut locations. Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the Y Gantry Body.    Tighten an M3 x 16mm screw into the Hex Nut installed in the previous step. Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the Y Gantry Support.    Tighten an M3 x 16mm screw into the Hex Nut installed in the previous step. Insert a M5x40mm machine screw into the Y Gantry Body through each of the two positions for the top rollers.    Place a V-Slot roller onto the two M5x40mm machine screws.    Insert M5 Hex Nuts into back side of Y Gantry Support and then place the Y gantry support onto the two M5x40mm machine screws.       Repeat steps 1-10 for the second Y gantry body \u0026 support  Final Assembly Place a gantry body assembly (steps 1-10 x 2) on each end of a v-slot extrusion. Don’t worry about pushing it all the way into the print; there’s extra space for adjustment.    Drop in and position a nut under the machine screw hole on the top of each gantry side and loosely thread a M5x10mm machine screw into each of the nuts. We do not want to tighten these yet; there is still adjusting to do.    Place the entire structure on top of the top rails of the frame    On both sides, below the rail, insert a v-slot roller with a roller spacer on each side. Then push a M5x40mm machine screw through the gantry and roller assembly.     Now roll the Y gantry to the very front of the machine. Adjust the fit of the Y gantry extrusion inside the roller assemblies you just made such that the top rollers fit perfectly into the v-slot. After you budge them in or out to make the top rollers sit perfect, tighten the top bolts you only loosely threaded a few steps ago. This is locking in the Y gantry extrusion spacing.\n  Now we need to make sure this spacing doesn’t just work for the front of the machine, but for the entire length of it as well. Loosen the machine screws holding in the staging plate, and the ones connecting the back rail to the left and right side. While applying light pressure down on the Y gantry, roll it to the back of the machine. You might find that you need to expand or contract the back legs to have the rollers ride perfectly in the v-slot. Once you have the correct spacing, tighten the bolts on the staging plate and the ones mounting the back rail. This locks in the Y gantry extrusion spacing for the back of the machine as well.\n  Wahoo! You’re all parallel! Now we can tighten the rollers on the Y gantry. Adjust the bottom rollers up so they snug against the extrusion and ensure that the v-slot rollers run well in the slots. This adjustment should be done with the M3x16mm screws in the bottom of the Y Gantry Body and Y Gantry Support. You want to make sure that there’s no play or wiggle in the fit, but don’t overtighten to the point of increasing resistance to rolling. The gantry should move easily, but not loosely.\n  Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X idler assembly to the right side gantry body. Note that this part does have a polarity: the head of the machine screw that holds the idler should be visible when looking down at the top of the machine.\n    Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X motor mount \u0026 gantry umbilical mount to the left side gantry body. The motor should be on top with the pulley facing downwards. The umbilical mount should be at the back, on the same side as the wires.

You should see something like below, lots of cables loosely attached to the front left leg, all looking for a home. We’re about to give them one!\nPlugging in We’ll first start by plugging in the Y motors you routed behind the motherboard in an earlier step. Plug the cable labeled Y1 into the left Y motor port on the motherboard, and plug the Y2 cable into the right.\nTODO(img of y cables plugged in)\nNext comes the USB cables. These will also have their cables run underneath the motherboard. Take the Bottom Camera USB cable and run it to the left across the staging plate, under the motherboard, and out the other side. Plug it into the USB port by the label Btm Cam and make sure the majority of the cable is stuffed underneath the board.\nTODO(img of cable plubbed in, rest of the cable underneath)\nNow we’ll do the same thing, but with the Top Camera cable.

Once this is done, the majority of the machine’s structure is built.\nNecessary Components \u0026 Tools Collect the necessary items to complete the X Gantry assembly. These are:\n 1x X Gantry Front (FDM-0011-00_x-gantry-front) 1x X Gantry Back (FDM-0012-00_x-gantry-back) 1x Z Gantry Left (FDM-0017-00_z-gantry-left) 1x Mirrored Z Gantry Left (FDM-0017-00_z-gantry-left, but in FreeCAD perform a Part Mirror around the YZ plane) 2x Roller Spacers (FDM-0009-00_roller-spacer) 1x … (Z axis roller spacer) 2x Belt Clamp (FDM-0025-00_belt-clamp) 1x NEMA 17 Stepper Motor (can use a pancake motor) 1x GT2 Pulley (5mm Bore) 1x GT2 Idler (5mm Bore) 1x GT2 Belt 7x M3x12mm Machine Screw 8x M3x6mm Machine Screw 6x M3x8mm Machine Screw 1x M5x30mm Machine Screw 2x M5x45mm Machine Screw 3x M5 Nylon Lock Nut 3x V-Slot Rollers (with bearings, 5mm Bore, 24mm diameter, 10.23mm outer width) 7x M3 Nut 7x M5 Nut 2x Linear Rail - 100mm 1x Limit Switch 2.5mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver 4mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver 3.3V power source  Assembly  We’ll start with the back X gantry print. Insert M5 Hex Nuts into all four of the hex nut locations on the X gantry back and push into the 3d print.     Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.\n  Insert two M3 Hex Nuts vertically into the two slots near each side of the print. Insert to more M3 nuts into the two horizontal slots near the bottom edge of the print.\n    Now, onto the front print of the X gantry. Insert M3 Hex Nuts into the six hex nut locations on the X gantry front and push into the 3d print. Also press two M3 nuts into the vertical slots in the back side of the print.        Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M3x12mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M3x12mm machine screw.\n  Insert a M5 nylock nut into the recess at the bottom of the X front gantry.\n    Insert a M5x45mm machine screw into each of the top two holes on the X Gantry Front which have a printed roller spacer. Onto each of the two machine screws, place a roller spacer, then a V-slot roller.    Place the X gantry rear onto the two machine screws    Add a M5 nut onto each of the two machine screws. Tighten the nylon lock nuts on the machine screws so that the two sides are snug against the V-slot rollers.    Place two linear rails onto the front of the X gantry and line up each one with the arrays of three holes on the left and right side. Place three M3x12mm machine screws into each of the rails (the far ends, then one in the middle) and tighten down.    Place the NEMA 17 motor so the shaft runs through the X gantry front and emerges on the same side as the linear rails. Make sure the motor’s connector is pointing towards the umbilical guide as shown in the image. Fasten the NEMA17 motor to the X gantry front using four M3x8mm machine screws.    At the top left of the assembly front, place a limit switch PCB. Fasten the limit switch PCB with two M3x8mm screws.    Place a M5x25mm machine screw through the GT2 idler and into the X gantry front. Secure this machine screw to the gantry by tightening it into M5 nylock nut inserted into the back side. Ensure that the fit is tight and there’s no wiggle in the idler, but also make sure that it can spin freely and isn’t seizing from overtightening.    Now it’s time to mount the Z gantries. Each gantry comes in two parts. The first is a back plate that sits against the linear rail carriage, and connects to the timing belt. These will always be on your machine. Even when you swap toolheads, these will stay attached to the linear rail. On top of these mounts the tool. We’ll be mounting a single Pick Head tool on the left Z gantry. Start by building the Left Z gantry subassembly. Insert four M3x10mm screws through the left z gantry, and then through the left z gantry back plate as shown in the images. Lastly, take the ???? mm strip of GT2 timing belt and slide it into the slot on the back side of the left Z gantry back plate. Ensure that it is perfectly centered along the length of the belt.       TODO(image of gt2 in this slot)\nThen mount the whole stack onto the left linear rail.    Now we’ll get the Z axis timing belt mounted. Start by placing the GT2 Pulley onto the Z motor shaft. Make sure the Z motor mounting hardware is loose and the motor is slid down in its hardware slots as far down as it can go. Feed the GT2 timing belt attached to the left Z carriage around the idler and the pulley. Slide each end of the belt into the right z gantry back plate, with each end meeting in the middle of the print. Slide the Z motor up in its hardware slots and check for belt tension. If you’re able to get the belt completely taut, great! If not, remove the loose ends of the belt, snip off a belt rib from one side, and try again.  TODO(pic of routing the belt around these two) TODO(pic of sliding the ends into the right plate) TODO(pic of checking tension)\nAfter you’re able to achieve proper tension without hitting the end of the Z motor mounting hardware slots, put the right z gantry onto the right z gantry back plate, and screw them into the linear rail gantry using four M3x10mm screws. Next, tighten the GT2 pulley onto the Z motor shaft. Make sure it’s in the correct Y position on the shaft so that it’s in line with the gantries and the idler at the bottom. Lastly, pull upwards on the Z motor until you achieve tension on the belt, then tighten the screws holding it on. Start with the screw at the top of the print, then the bottom, then the two side screws.  TODO(pic of tightening the right z gantry in place with belt) TODO(pic tightening the z pulley) TODO(pic pulling up on z motor and tightening)\nNow that our Z gantries are all tightened and moving freely, we can mount our final axis: rotation! Take your NEMA?? hollow shaft stepper motor, and place it in the left z gantry. Secure it in place with four M2.5x8mm screws.    Now we’ll mount a few bits of hardware to the hollow shaft motor. Screw the CP40 nozzle holder into the bottom side of the motor, and screw the press-fit pneumatic coupler into the top side.    Fit two of the GT2 belt clamps onto the back of the X gantry, and lightly secure them in place with four M5x10mm screws.    Lastly, we’ll mount the top camera and ring light. First we’ll make the camera subassembly, then mount it to the gantry. Begin by placing the ring light facing downwards into the down light mount. Then place the down camera mount on top, ensuring that the tab from the down light mount fits into the recess. These two prints will pinch the top ring light in place. Lastly, fit the top camera into the down camera mount. Make sure the connector on the back side of the camera is between the two arms of the down camera mount.  TODO(picture of putting the top ring light in the diffusor print)\n     Secure the whole stack in place with four M2.5x20mm screws. Tighten them down so that all parts are tightly held together, but don’t overtorque; these screws are threading into the plastic of a print.    Mount the top camera and light subassembly onto the back of the X gantry using two M3x14mm screws.
